Hello

This is the Street Basketball game where the player has to throw a ball through all three hoops.

The player can grab the basketballs by pressing the trigger button while touching the ball.

The player can move using the thumbsticks, or just by moving IRL.
(Be cautious, moving could cause nausea to some users)

The player has to start the game/timer by pressing A, and after that, the timer will run for 60 seconds during which the player has to throw the balls.

The player can also restart the scene at any point by pressing B.

Pressing Menu will quit the game.

The hands were originally implemented so that the player had to press the grip button to grab and the hands would animate with the trigger and grip buttons. 
I decided to only use the trigger for the interaction and animations, because using the grip to grab and throw would eventually lead to someone throwing the controller at something/-one.

A lot of free assets from Unity asset store were used.
